A product landing page project built in 2024 as part of my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification journey. Posted here to preserve my progress.

The project only consists of **HTML** + **CSS** and was made as a part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course.

## 🎨 About the Project

This was my first experience building a product-focused landing page with a sticky navbar, embedded video, and email capture form. I remember being excited to finally use Flexbox properly — it felt like magic after struggling with floats and inline-blocks!<br> The most memorable part is its logo: I manually fixed svg and text to become a logo of the page, even though it breaks on a smaller screens I think it was a great achievement at the beginning of this journey.

Looking back now, I can see how far I've come. It was the moment CSS layouts started to *click* for me.

For previous FCC's projects from that course I only changed the images to be local but for this one i didn't do it since they are Flaticon imports. And since its screen breakpoints are not satisfactory for the mobile devices only one GIF is displayed.
